# Email Security Toolkit

This toolkit provides Python scripts for enhancing email security and supporting cybersecurity operations. Below are some ways in which these scripts can be utilized in the field of cybersecurity:

## Detection and Analysis of Email-based Attacks
- Detect suspicious email attachments or content.
- Analyze outgoing emails for indicators of compromise.
- Trigger alerts or quarantine emails based on predefined criteria.

## Penetration Testing
- Simulate phishing attacks or email-based malware distribution.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of email security controls and user awareness training.
- Assess the organization's readiness to defend against email threats.

## Incident Response
- Extract email data from mail servers or archives during incident investigations.
- Identify signs of malicious activity or communication with threat actors.
- Reconstruct timelines of events based on email communications.

## Email Forensics
- Retrieve email evidence for forensic analysis.
- Examine email headers, message content, and attachments for intelligence gathering.
- Support investigations into breaches, malware infections, or other security incidents.

## Security Awareness Training
- Conduct security awareness exercises by sending simulated phishing emails.
- Assess employees' susceptibility to phishing attacks and provide targeted training.
- Improve overall security awareness and behavior within the organization.

**Note:** The scripts provided in this toolkit should be used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized use for malicious activities may result in legal consequences.

Feel free to contribute to this toolkit by adding new scripts, improving existing ones, or providing feedback. Together, we can enhance email security and strengthen cybersecurity defenses.
